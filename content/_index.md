I am a Research Engineer at ASUS Singapore.
I received both my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science and Information Engineering from National Taiwan University, where I worked with [Prof. Hsuan-Tien Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/) and [Prof. Kuan-Hao Huang](https://khhuang.me).
My research focuses on developing trustworthy NLP and multimodal models by addressing challenges in robustness and interpretability.
