### National Taiwan University
I am deeply passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge with others. Throughout my time at NTU, I had the opportunity to work closely with students and contribute to their learning. I served as a teaching assistant for the following courses:
* CSIE5043: [Machine Learning](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/ml23spring/), Spring 2023
* CSIE3005: [Foundations of Artificial Intelligence](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~htlin/course/fai22spring/), Spring 2022
